Thanks for checking out Gravity!

This is just a small side project I did for a few days while I was experimenting with the PyGame library, it's nothing special. I may add stuff every now and again for fun, but it should not be considered active development. Feel free to fork this project or just read over it; hopefully it will help you learn as much as it helped me.

To run, make sure you have pygame installed properly and simply run the python file. You can click and drag to add more dots, and <space> + click to make an explosion. Dots hit by an explosion will subsequently explode, possibly causing a chain reaction. Have fun!
